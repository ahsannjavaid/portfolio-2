## **Introduction**

Starting the dev-log journey, let us start with the creation of this very website you are looking at.

This blog platform has been an ongoing personal project of mine starting in the Summer of 2022 alongside [Viz- Diagramming made easy](https://viz.nathanluong.me).

## **ü§î How it's made**

The tech stack of the site is composed with:

- **React.js** as front-end (using native state management)
- **Next.js** as a meta-framework to support **Static Site Generation**
- No backend since Next.js supports **route-based API** (which saves lots of time).
- **MySQL** database hosted on **PlanetScale**.
- **Prisma** as database ORM (since **Prisma Studio** is very powerful)
- Domain name hosted on **namecheap.com**
- The entire website is hosted on **Vercel**.

The source code is available on my personal GitHub.

## **ü§î What features does it have**

- **Fully Responsive**: The site looks good (hopefully) on any device (Lots of Math to figure out the 3D view scaling üôÉ).
- **Blog viewing**: Head out to `/blogs` to see all newly published blogs.
- **Authentication**: Only the owner of the site can log in to the admin view with their corresponding credentials.
- **Blog writing**: Using the built-in markdown editor admin can write and preview their blogs before publishing.
- **Blog Publishing**: Publish blogs with additional metadata.
