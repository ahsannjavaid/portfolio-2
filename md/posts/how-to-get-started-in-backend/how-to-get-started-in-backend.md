## **Pre-requisite**

Before getting into backend development, make sure to fimiliarize with the following concept and technologies:

- **VSCode**: Most professional software engineers use VSCode as their primary development editor. VSCode comes on top with its endless support and plugins for web-dev and especially backend-related work.
- **Python**: [By servey](https://statisticsanddata.org/data/most-popular-backend-frameworks-2012-2022/), both Python [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) are in the Top 10 most popular backend framework. With its beginer-friendly syntax and amazing support from the community, learning Python is **the easiest** entry to backend development.

## **Starter Projects**

### **ðŸ‘‰ String Reverse REST API** (â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†)

**Task**: Create a RESTFUL API which reverse a string on requests

**Purpose**: Getting fimiliar with REST, browsers, servers and local development.

## **Intermidiate Projects**

### **ðŸ‘‰ Todo List App** (â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†)

**Task**: Create todo app where users can add, remove, edit and manage todos.

**Purpose**: Getting fimiliar with the front-end/ back-end dynamics, as well as front-end Javascript.

**Hint**: Todos do not need to be stored in a database, a text file on the backend side should work.

### **ðŸ‘‰ Real-time Stock/Crypto Price Monitoring** (â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†)

**Task**: Create an application where user can monitor real-time stock/crypto price in USD.

**Purpose**: Getting fimiliar with Websocket, real-time rendering.

**Hint**: It's easier to use a front-end framework (like ReactJs) to help with DOM manipulation and realtime UI rendering.

## **Advanced Projects**

### **ðŸ‘‰ Social Media Clone** (â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†)

**Task**: Create a social media clone of choice (Facebook, Instagram, Spotify) that deals with authentication and complex CRUD operations.

**Bonus Point ðŸ’¸**: Try containerizing your app and host it on AWS, GCP, or Azure.

**Purpose**: Consolidate your understanding on authentication, webSocket, stateful backends. Getting fimiliar with industry-standard cloud providers.

### **ðŸ‘‰ Some cloud based software with serious scale** (â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…)

Congratulation ðŸŽ‰, if you are at this point, you are a rock star engineering student. Since most of these projects are local and self hosted, it would be difficult to practice your backend skills without any actual volume. My suggestion is to start looking into industry leading technologies, such as Kafka, K8S, etc., as well as mastering one cloud provider (AWS for me).
