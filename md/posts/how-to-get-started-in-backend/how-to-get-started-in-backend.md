## Pre-requisite

Before getting into backend development, make sure to familiarize yourself with the following concept and technologies:

- **VSCode**: Most professional software engineers use VSCode as their primary development editor. VSCode comes on top with its endless support and plugins for web dev and especially backend-related work.
- **Python**: [By survey](https://statisticsanddata.org/data/most-popular-backend-frameworks-2012-2022/), both Python [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) are in the Top 10 most popular backend framework. With its beginner-friendly syntax and amazing support from the community, learning Python is **the easiest** entry to backend development.

## Starter Projects

### ðŸ‘‰ String Reverse REST API (â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†)

**Task**: Create a RESTFUL API that reverses a string on requests

**Purpose**: Getting familiar with REST, browsers, servers and local development.

## Intermediate Projects

### ðŸ‘‰ Todo List App (â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†)

**Task**: Create a todo app where users can add, remove, edit and manage todos.

**Purpose**: Getting familiar with the front-end/ back-end dynamics, as well as front-end Javascript.

**Hint**: Todos do not need to be stored in a database, a text file on the backend side should work.

### ðŸ‘‰ Real-time Stock/Crypto Price Monitoring (â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†)

**Task**: Create an application where users can monitor real-time stock/crypto prices in USD.

**Purpose**: Getting familiar with WebSocket, and real-time rendering.

**Hint**: It's easier to use a front-end framework (like ReactJs) to help with DOM manipulation and real-time UI rendering.

## Advanced Projects

### ðŸ‘‰ Social Media Clone (â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†)

**Task**: Create a social media clone of choice (Facebook, Instagram, Spotify) that deals with authentication and complex CRUD operations.

**Bonus Point ðŸ’¸**: Try containerizing your app and host it on AWS, GCP, or Azure.

**Purpose**: Consolidate your understanding of authentication, webSocket, and stateful backends. Getting familiar with industry-standard cloud providers.

### ðŸ‘‰ Some cloud-based software with serious scale (â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…)

Congratulation ðŸŽ‰, if you are at this point, you are a rock-star engineering student. Since most of these projects are local and self-hosted, it would be difficult to practice your backend skills without any actual volume. My suggestion is to start looking into industry-leading technologies, such as Kafka, K8S, etc., as well as mastering one cloud provider (AWS for me).

## Thanks for your time! ðŸ˜„
