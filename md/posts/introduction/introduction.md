## **👋 Hi there! Welcome to my tech repository**

I'm a senior university student, back-end developer, tech enthusiast, and aspiring software architect.
Throughout my co-op and leadership experiences, I realized the power of connections and mentorship within the tech space!

## **🤔 Why does this repository exist?**

Witnessing lots of students struggling with their starting point in tech, I noticed a big problem:

> Students are **NOT** exposed to industry-standard technologies at school, yet mastering these technologies is the only way to get started with the industry.

Obviously, some concepts are fundamental to the craft of software building (such as Data Structures, Algorithms, OOP, Theory of Computation, etc). However, knowing how and when to apply these concepts within an enterprise environment is another craft by itself.

> Therefore, I created this free platform, aiming to **speed up student's learning** journey in becoming a job-ready software engineer, at the same time, sharing about all things back-end.

## **🤔 Which topics will be covered?**

### **👉 Technical Topics**

My site will cover a lot of back-end fundamentals and advanced concepts:

- Communication Protocols (https, wss, quic)
- HTTP versions comparison (1.1, 2.0, 3.0)
- HTTP servers (Nginx, Apache)
- Back-end framework comparison (Django, Flask, Node, Spring Boot)
- Useful Apache Projects (Maven, Flink, Kafka, Spark, Superset, Airflow, Zookeeper, Hadoop)
- Fundamental AWS services (S3, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk, CloudFront)
- Containerization and Orchestration (Docker, K8S, Apache Mesos)
- Microservices architectural patterns (Too many patterns to list here 🙁🙁)

### **👉 Non-technical Topics**

Aiming to help students landing their first tech job ASAP, some articles will be dedicated to:

- How to build up and develop your network from zero.
- Becoming a back-end developer from zero (The fast way).
- A different way of looking at university/college.
- What to do when you have zero job experiences.
