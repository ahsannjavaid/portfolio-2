# Introduction

## **üëã Hi there! Welcome to my tech repository**

![McMaster University](/posts/introduction/mcmaster.png)

I'm a senior university student, back-end developer, tech enthusiast, and aspiring software architect.
Throughout my co-op and leadership experiences, I realized the power of connections and mentorship within the tech space!

## **ü§î Why does this repository exists?**

Having to witnesed students with great potential but struggling with their starting point in tech, I noticed a big problem:

> Students are **NOT** exposed to industry-standard technologies at school, yet mastering these technologies is the only way to get into the industry.

In another word, purely focussing on school material will give students an extremely hard time getting their first ever experience.

Obviously, some courses are fundamental to the craft of software development (Data Structure and Algorithm, OOP, Theory of Computation, ...). However, students will understand them in depth by taking a more hands-on approach.

> Therefore, through this platform, I'm aiming to **speed up student's learning** journey in becoming a job-ready software engineer, at the same time sharing about all things back-end.

## **ü§î Which topics will be covered?**

### **Non-technical Topics**

Aiming to help students landing their first tech job as fast as possible, some articles will be dedicate to:

- How to build up and develop your network from zero.
- Becoming a back-end developer from zero (The fast way).
- A different way of looking at university / college.
- What to do when you have zero job experience.

### **Technical Topics**

My site covers a lot of back-end fundamentals and advance concepts:

- Communication Protocols (https, wss, quic)
- HTTP versions comparison (1.1, 2.0, 3.0)
- HTTP servers (Nginx, Apache)
- Back-end framework comparison (Django, Flask, Node, Spring Boot)
- Useful Apache Projects (Maven, Flink, Kafka, Spark, Superset, Airflow, Zookeeper, Hadoop)
- Fundamental AWS services (S3, Lambda, Elastic beanstalk, CloudFront)
- Containerization and Ochestration (Docker, K8S, Apache Mesos)
- Microservices architectural patterns (Too many patterns to list here üôÅüôÅ)
