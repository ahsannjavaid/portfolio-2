# Introduction

<!-- ## Main Body -->

## üëã Hi there! Welcome to my tech repository!

I'm a senior university student, back-end developer, tech enthusiast, and aspiring software architect.
Throughout my co-op and leadership experiences, I realized the power of connections and mentorship within the tech space!

## **ü§î Why this repository exists?**

Witnessing a lot of students, who are full of great potential, struggling with their starting point. I noticed a big problem:

> Students are NOT exposed to industry-standard technologies at school, yet mastering these technologies is the only way to get jobs.

In another word, purely focussing on school material will give you an extremely hard time getting your first job.

Obviously, some courses are fundamental to understand (Data Structure and Algorithm, OOP, Theory of Computation, ...). However, you will understand them in depth by taking a more hands-on approach (applying them to your own side project)!

> Therefore, through this platform, I'm aiming to **speed up your learning** journey in becoming a job-ready software engineer, at the same time posting about all things back-end.

## **ü§î Which topic will be covered?**

### **Technical Topics**

My site will cover a lot of back-end fundamentals that a lot of programmers skip during their learning careers. Future topics will include:

- Communication Protocols (https, wss, quic)
- HTTP versions comparison (1.1, 2.0, 3.0)
- HTTP servers (Nginx, Apache)
- Back-end framework comparison (Django, Flask, Node, Spring Boot)
- Useful Apache Projects (Maven, Flink, Kafka, Spark, Superset, Airflow, Zookeeper, Hadoop)
- Must-know AWS services (S3, Lambda, Elastic beanstalk, CloudFront)
- Containerization and Ochestration (Docker, K8S, Apache Mesos)
- Microservices architectural patterns (Too many patterns to list here üôÅüôÅ)

### **Non-technical Topics**

Aiming to help students landing their first tech job as fast as possible, some articles will be dedicate to:

- How to build up and develop your network from zero.
- Becoming a back-end developer from nothing (The fast way).
- A different way to look at university.
- What to do when you have zero job experience.
- Acing your interview.
